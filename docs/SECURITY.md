# Security Guidelines for my-tmux-project

#Security - Policies and best practices for secure development

## Secrets Management
- Store API keys and tokens in a secrets manager (e.g., Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- Never commit sensitive data to the repository.
- Use environment variables in `config/index.ts`.

## Access Control
- Secure endpoints with `middleware/authMiddleware.ts` using API keys or OAuth2.
- Restrict repository write access to authorized maintainers.

## Dependency Management
- Run `npm audit` before releases to check vulnerabilities.
- Use Dependabot in `.github/dependabot.yml` for updates.

## Incident Response
- Configure `middleware/errorHandler.ts` to send alerts to Slack/Discord.
- Report security issues to [your-email@example.com].

## Code Reviews
- Require PR reviews for all changes, especially in `agents/` and `middleware/`.
