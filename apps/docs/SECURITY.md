# Security policies and best practices #Security

# Security Guidelines for my-tmux-project

## Secrets Management
- Store sensitive data (API keys, tokens) in GitHub Secrets or HashiCorp Vault.
- Never commit `.env` files or secrets to the repository.
- Use environment variables in `config/index.ts` for secure configuration.

## Access Control
- API endpoints require authentication via `authMiddleware.ts` (e.g., API keys or OAuth2).
- Restrict repository write access to authorized maintainers.

## Dependency Management
- Run `npm audit` before releases to check for vulnerabilities.
- Use Dependabot (configured in `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`) for automatic dependency updates.

## Incident Response
- Configure error logging in `middleware/errorHandler.ts` to send alerts to Slack/Discord.
- Report security issues to [your-email@example.com].

## Code Reviews
- All pull requests require at least one reviewer.
- Pay special attention to changes in `middleware/`, `services/`, and `agents/`.

## Security Tools
- Integrate CodeQL and Snyk in CI/CD for automated vulnerability scanning.
- Use ESLint security plugins in `.eslintrc.json`.
